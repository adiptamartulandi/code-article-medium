      "\n",
      "2. **Returns**:\n",
      "   - **Stock**: Returns come in the form of dividends and capital gains. Dividend payments are not guaranteed and depend on the company's profitability.\n",
      "   - **Bond**: Returns are usually fixed and come in the form of regular interest payments (also known as coupon payments). Bonds are generally seen as lower-risk investments compared to stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Risk**:\n",
      "   - **Stock**: Higher risk due to price volatility and the company's performance, which can affect the stock price.\n",
      "   - **Bond**: Typically lower risk, especially government bonds, although they are subject to interest rate risk and the credit risk of the issuer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Voting Rights**:\n",
      "   - **Stock**: Shareholders often have voting rights in the company, allowing them to vote on corporate matters.\n",
      "   - **Bond**: Bondholders do not have voting rights in the company.\n",
